# 3. REGRESSION (PREDICT CONTINUOUS VALUES / ESTIMATION)

This section explains **Regression**, which is another major type of **Supervised Learning (SL)**.

Classification predicts **categories**

Example:
- Spam / Not Spam
- Approve / Reject

Regression predicts **numbers**

Example:
- House Price = RM500,000
- Temperature = 32.5°C

Regression answers:

**"What exact number should be predicted?"**
