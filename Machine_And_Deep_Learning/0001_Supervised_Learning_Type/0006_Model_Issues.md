# 6. MODEL ISSUES

This section explains common problems that happen when training Machine Learning (ML) models.

Most models do **not work perfectly on the first try**.

Common problems:

- Model learns too little
- Model learns too much
- Model learns wrong patterns
- Model becomes unstable
- Model performs well in training but fails in real life

```text
1. House data:
   - Size
   - Location
   - Bedrooms

2. Model used:
   Very simple Linear Regression

3. Real house prices are complex

4. Model predicts:
   Every house ≈ RM500,000

5. Result:
   Wrong predictions for expensive and cheap houses
```

Model predicts poorly because important information is missing
```

---

# 6.3 Overfitting

This section explains when the model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns.

Training performance looks amazing.

Real-world performance becomes bad.

---

## 6.3.1 Overfitting Symptoms

| Metric | Behavior | Problem | Result | Warning Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Training Accuracy | Very high | Looks great | Misleading | High |
| Testing Accuracy | Low | Poor generalization | Fails new data | High |
| Model Complexity | Too high | Too flexible | Memorization | High |

## 6.3.2 Example A: Spam Detection Overfitting (Detailed)

```text
1. Training spam emails contain:
   "Free"
   "Win"
   "Prize"

2. Model memorizes:
   Every email with "free" = spam

3. New email:
   "Free office meeting room available"

4. Model predicts:
   Spam

5. Result:
   Wrong prediction
```

---

## 6.3.3 Example B: House Price Overfitting (Detailed)

```text
1. Model memorizes exact training house prices

2. New house enters system

3. House is slightly different

4. Model fails to predict correctly
```

---

# 6.4 Good Fit (Balanced Model)

This section explains the ideal learning situation.

The model learns useful patterns and generalizes well.

---

## 6.4.1 Good Fit Characteristics

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Error | Low | Low | Good predictions | Healthy |
| Generalization | Strong | Strong | Real-world success | Best |

---

## 6.4.2 Example A: House Price Good Fit (Detailed)

```text
1. Model learns:
   Bigger house → higher price
   Better location → higher price

2. New house enters system

3. Model predicts accurately

4. Real-world prediction works well
```

# 6.5 Underfitting vs Overfitting vs Good Fit

This section compares the three major model states.

| Model State | Training Error | Testing Error | Problem | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Underfitting | High | High | Too simple | Weak regression |
| Good Fit | Low | Low | Balanced | Stable model |
| Overfitting | Low | High | Too complex | Memorization |

---

## 6.5.1 Example Comparison (Detailed)

```text
Underfitting:
Predicts everything badly

Good Fit:
Predicts most cases correctly

Overfitting:
Perfect training results but fails new cases
```

---

# 6.6 Bias

This section explains error caused by overly simple assumptions.

High bias often causes underfitting.

---

## 6.6.1 Example A: High Bias (Detailed)

```text
Salary prediction model:

Only uses:
Years of experience

Ignores:
Education
Skills
Industry

Predictions become inaccurate
```

---

# 6.7 Variance

This section explains error caused by extreme sensitivity to training data.

High variance often causes overfitting.

---

## 6.7.1 Example A: High Variance (Detailed)

```text
House A:
RM500,000

Very similar House B:
RM510,000

Model predicts:
RM500,000 for A
RM900,000 for B

Model is unstable
```

---

# 6.8 Bias vs Variance Tradeoff

This section explains balancing simple vs complex models.

---

## 6.8.1 Tradeoff Table

| Model Complexity | Bias | Variance | Result | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Very Complex | Low | High | Overfitting | Unstable |

---

## 6.8.2 Example A: Decision Tree Depth (Detailed)
